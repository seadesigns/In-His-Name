      	<h1>About Us:</h1>
      	<p>In His Hands Ministries was originally founded by Rev. Dr. Sharon K. Jones in 2005 and was later redeveloped into the ministry it is today. Along with her husband Minister Kirk Lomotey, they have developed a ministry that not only helps churches create effective and efficient ministries, but they also specialize in creating church leaders who can inspire, lead and motivate the people of God.  
		Additionally, we also serve as a staffing ministry that provide churches with the best fit for their teams whether they are searching for pastors, or other leaders of support. IHHM provides training and leadership development to clergy who would like to sharpen their ministerial gifts and skills. </p>
